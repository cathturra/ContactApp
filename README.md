PLANNING

The project requirements were to create an app which signs up and logs in a user, as well as obtaining contact information and storing this within Firebase.

Two forms of database storage are used here. Postgresql was used in order to store new sign up information and proceed to use this data as a requirement for login. Firebase was utilized in order to store contact information.
